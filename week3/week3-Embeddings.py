# # Find duplicate questions on StackOverflow by their embeddings
# 
# In this assignment you will learn how to calculate a similarity for pieces of text. Using this approach you will know how to find duplicate questions from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com).

# ### Libraries
# 
# In this task you will you will need the following libraries:
# - [StarSpace](https://github.com/facebookresearch/StarSpace) — a general-purpose model for efficient learning of entity embeddings from Facebook
# - [Gensim](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/) — a tool for solving various NLP-related tasks (topic modeling, text representation, ...)
# - [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org) — a package for scientific computing.
# - [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) — a tool for data mining and data analysis.
# - [Nltk](http://www.nltk.org) — a platform to work with human language data.

# ### Data
# 
# The following cell will download all data required for this assignment into the folder `week3/data`.

# In[ ]:


import sys
sys.path.append("..")
from common.download_utils import download_week3_resources

# ### Grading
# We will create a grader instace below and use it to collect your answers. Note that these outputs will be stored locally inside grader and will be uploaded to platform only after running submiting function in the last part of this assignment. If you want to make partial submission, you can run that cell any time you want.

# ## Word embedding
# 
# To solve the problem, you will use two different models of embeddings:
# 
#  - [Pre-trained word vectors](https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/) from Google which were trained on a part of Google News dataset (about 100 billion words). The model contains 300-dimensional vectors for 3 million words and phrases. `GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin.gz` will be downloaded in `download_week3_resources()`.
#  - Representations using StarSpace on StackOverflow data sample. You will need to train them from scratch.

# It's always easier to start with pre-trained embeddings. Unpack the pre-trained Goggle's vectors and upload them using the function [KeyedVectors.load_word2vec_format](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/keyedvectors.html) from gensim library with the parameter *binary=True*. If the size of the embeddings is larger than the avaliable memory, you could load only a part of the embeddings by defining the parameter *limit* (recommended: 500000).

wv_embeddings = ######### YOUR CODE HERE #############


# ### How to work with Google's word2vec embeddings?
# 
# Once you have loaded the representations, make sure you can access them. First, you can check if the loaded embeddings contain a word:
#     
#     'word' in wv_embeddings
#     
# Second, to get the corresponding embedding you can use the square brackets:
# 
#     wv_embeddings['word']
#  
# ### Checking that the embeddings are correct 
#  
# To prevent any errors during the first stage, we can check that the loaded embeddings are correct. You can call the function *check_embeddings*, implemented below, which runs 3 tests:
# 1. Find the most similar word for provided "positive" and "negative" words.
# 2. Find which word from the given list doesn’t go with the others.
# 3. Find the most similar word for the provided one.
# 
# In the right case the function will return the string *These embeddings look good*. Othervise, you need to validate the previous steps.

# In[ ]:


def check_embeddings(embeddings):
    error_text = "Something wrong with your embeddings ('%s test isn't correct)."
    most_similar = embeddings.most_similar(positive=['woman', 'king'], negative=['man'])
    if len(most_similar) < 1 or most_similar[0][0] != 'queen':
        return error_text % "Most similar"

    doesnt_match = embeddings.doesnt_match(['breakfast', 'cereal', 'dinner', 'lunch'])
    if doesnt_match != 'cereal':
        return error_text % "Doesn't match"
    
    most_similar_to_given = embeddings.most_similar_to_given('music', ['water', 'sound', 'backpack', 'mouse'])
    if most_similar_to_given != 'sound':
        return error_text % "Most similar to given"
    
    return "These embeddings look good."

# ## From word to text embeddings
# 
# **Task 1 (Question2Vec).** Usually, we have word-based embeddings, but for the task we need to create a representation for the whole question. It could be done in different ways. In our case we will use a **mean** of all word vectors in the question. Now you need to implement the function *question_to_vec*, which calculates the question representation described above. This function should work with the input text as is without any preprocessing.
# 
# Note that there could be words without the corresponding embeddings. In this case, you can just skip these words and don't take them into account during calculating the result. If the question doesn't contain any known word with embedding, the function should return a zero vector.

# Now we have a method to create a representation of any sentence and we are ready for the first evaluation. So, let's check how well our solution (Google's vectors + *question_to_vec*) will work.
# 
# ## Evaluation of text similarity
# 
# We can imagine that if we use good embeddings, the cosine similarity between the duplicate sentences should be less than for the random ones. Overall, for each pair of duplicate sentences we can generate *R* random negative examples and find out the position of the correct duplicate.  
# 
# For example, we have the question *"Exceptions What really happens"* and we are sure that another question *"How does the catch keyword determine the type of exception that was thrown"* is a duplicate. But our model doesn't know it and tries to find out the best option also among questions like *"How Can I Make These Links Rotate in PHP"*, *"NSLog array description not memory address"* and *"PECL_HTTP not recognised php ubuntu"*. The goal of the model is to rank all these 4 questions (1 *positive* and *R* = 3 *negative*) in the way that the correct one is in the first place.
# 
# However, it is unnatural to count on that the best candidate will be always in the first place. So let us consider the place of the best candidate in the sorted list of candidates and formulate a metric based on it. We can fix some *K* — a reasonalble number of top-ranked elements and *N* — a number of queries (size of the sample).
# 
# ### Hits@K
# 
# The first simple metric will be a number of correct hits for some *K*:
# $$ \text{Hits@K} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N \, [dup_i \in topK(q_i)]$$
# 
# where $q_i$ is the i-th query, $dup_i$ is its duplicate, $topK(q_i)$ is the top K elements of the ranked sentences provided by our model and the operation $[dup_i \in topK(q_i)]$ equals 1 if the condition is true and 0 otherwise (more details about this operation could be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iverson_bracket)).
# 
# 
# ### DCG@K
# The second one is a simplified [DCG metric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discounted_cumulative_gain):
# 
# $$ \text{DCG@K} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N\frac{1}{\log_2(1+rank_{dup_i})}\cdot[rank_{dup_i} \le K] $$
# 
# where $rank_{dup_i}$ is a position of the duplicate in the sorted list of the nearest sentences for the query $q_i$. According to this metric, the model gets a higher reward for a higher position of the correct answer. If the answer does not appear in topK at all, the reward is zero. 

# ### Evaluation examples
# 
# Let's calculate the described metrics for the toy example introduced above. In this case $N$ = 1 and the correct candidate for $q_1$ is *"How does the catch keyword determine the type of exception that was thrown"*. Consider the following ranking of the candidates:
# 1. *"How Can I Make These Links Rotate in PHP"*
# 2. *"How does the catch keyword determine the type of exception that was thrown"*
# 3. *"NSLog array description not memory address"*
# 4. *"PECL_HTTP not recognised php ubuntu"*
# 
# Using the ranking above, calculate *Hits@K* metric for *K = 1, 2, 4*: 
#  
# - [K = 1] $\text{Hits@1} = \frac{1}{1}\sum_{i=1}^1 \, [dup_i \in top1(q_i)] = [dup_1 \in top1(q_1)] = 0$ because the correct answer doesn't appear in the *top1* list.
# - [K = 2] $\text{Hits@2} = \frac{1}{1}\sum_{i=1}^1 \, [dup_i \in top2(q_i)] = [dup_1 \in top2(q_1)] = 1$ because $rank_{dup_1} = 2$.
# - [K = 4] $\text{Hits@4} = \frac{1}{1}\sum_{i=1}^1 \, [dup_i \in top4(q_i)] = [dup_1 \in top4(q_1)] = 1$
# 
# Using the ranking above, calculate *DCG@K* metric for *K = 1, 2, 4*:
# 
# - [K = 1] $\text{DCG@1} = \frac{1}{1} \sum_{i=1}^1\frac{1}{\log_2(1+rank_{dup_i})}\cdot[rank_{dup_i} \le 1] = \frac{1}{\log_2(1+rank_{dup_i})}\cdot[rank_{dup_i} \le 1] = 0$ because the correct answer doesn't appear in the top1 list.
# - [K = 2] $\text{DCG@2} = \frac{1}{1} \sum_{i=1}^1\frac{1}{\log_2(1+rank_{dup_i})}\cdot[rank_{dup_i} \le 2] = \frac{1}{\log_2{3}}$, because $rank_{dup_1} = 2$.
# - [K = 4] $\text{DCG@4} = \frac{1}{1} \sum_{i=1}^1\frac{1}{\log_2(1+rank_{dup_i})}\cdot[rank_{dup_i} \le 4] = \frac{1}{\log_2{3}}$.
# 

# **Tasks 2 and 3 (HitsCount and DCGScore).** Implement the functions *hits_count* and *dcg_score* as described above. Each function has two arguments: *dup_ranks* and *k*. *dup_ranks* is a list which contains *values of ranks* of duplicates. For example, *dup_ranks* is *[2]* for the example provided above.

# ## Advanced solution: StarSpace embeddings
# 
# Now you are ready to train your own word embeddings! In particular, you need to train embeddings specially for our task of duplicates detection. Unfortunately, StarSpace cannot be run on Windows and we recommend to use provided
# [docker container](https://github.com/hse-aml/natural-language-processing/blob/master/Docker-tutorial.md) or other alternatives. Don't delete results of this task because you will need it in the final project.
# 
# ### How it works and what's the main difference with word2vec?
# The main point in this section is that StarSpace can be trained specifically for some tasks. In contrast to word2vec model, which tries to train similar embeddings for words in similar contexts, StarSpace uses embeddings for the whole sentence (just as a sum of embeddings of words and phrases). Despite the fact that in both cases we get word embeddings as a result of the training, StarSpace embeddings are trained using some supervised data, e.g. a set of similar sentence pairs, and thus they can better suit the task.
# 
# In our case, StarSpace should use two types of sentence pairs for training: "positive" and "negative". "Positive" examples are extracted from the train sample (duplicates, high similarity) and the "negative" examples are generated randomly (low similarity assumed). 
# 
# ### How to choose the best params for the model?
# Normally, you would start with some default choice and then run extensive experiments to compare different strategies. However, we have some recommendations ready for you to save your time:
# - Be careful with choosing the suitable training mode. In this task we want to explore texts similarity which corresponds to *trainMode = 3*.
# - Use adagrad optimization (parameter *adagrad = true*).
# - Set the length of phrase equal to 1 (parameter *ngrams*), because we need embeddings only for words.
# - Don't use a large number of *epochs* (we think that 5 should be enough).
# - Try dimension *dim* equal to 100.
# - To compare embeddings usually *cosine* *similarity* is used.
# - Set *minCount* greater than 1 (for example, 2) if you don't want to get embeddings for extremely rare words.
# - Parameter *verbose = true* could show you the progress of the training process.
# - Set parameter *fileFormat* equals *labelDoc*.
# - Parameter *negSearchLimit* is responsible for a number of negative examples which is used during the training. We think that 10 will be enought for this task.
# - To increase a speed of training we recommend to set *learning rate* to 0.05.

# Train StarSpace embeddings for unigrams on the train dataset. You don't need to change the format of the input data. Just don't forget to use prepared version of the training data. 
# 
# If you follow the instruction, the training process will take about 1 hour. The size of the embeddings' dictionary should be approximately 100 000 (number of lines in the result file). If you got significantly more than this number, try to check all the instructions above.

######### TRAINING HAPPENING HERE #############


# And now we can compare the new embeddings with the previous ones. You can find trained word vectors in the file *[model_file_name].tsv*. Upload the embeddings from StarSpace into a dict.

for k in [1, 5, 10, 100, 500, 1000]:

                                               k, hits_count(ss_prepared_ranking, k)))


# Due to training for the particular task with the supervised data, you should expect to obtain a higher quality than for the previous approach. In additiion, despite the fact that StarSpace's trained vectors have a smaller dimension than word2vec's, it provides better results in this task.
